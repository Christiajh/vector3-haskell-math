# üìê Vector3: 3D Math Library in Haskell

A **simple, modular, and educational 3D vector library** built in **Haskell**. This project demonstrates key concepts of **functional programming**, precision-safe **vector mathematics**, and clean code design using algebraic data types and pattern matching.

> üìù This project was developed as part of the **midterm exam (UTS) for Semester 2** in the *Dasar Pemrograman* course.
